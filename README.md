🔹 1. Introduction to Computer Vision
Computer Vision (CV) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images or videos. 
It automates tasks that the human visual system can do, like detecting objects, classifying images, or tracking movements.

🔹 2. Common Tasks in Computer Vision
•	Image Classification – Classify an image into a category (e.g., dog, cat, car).
•	Object Detection – Locate and identify multiple objects in an image (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN).
•	Image Segmentation – Classify each pixel in an image (e.g., UNet, Mask R-CNN).
•	Instance Segmentation – Separate and identify each object instance.
•	Image Generation – Generate new images from input (e.g., GANs, Pix2Pix).
•	Image Captioning – Generate descriptive text for an image.
•	Face Recognition – Identify or verify individuals based on facial features.
•	Pose Estimation – Detect body keypoints and skeletal structure.
•	OCR (Optical Character Recognition) – Read and extract text from images.
